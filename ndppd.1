ndppd \- NDP Proxy Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ndppd [-d] [-c <config-file>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ndppd
frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal
symbol tables. By default it parses all baz segments
and rearranges them in reverse order by time for the
.BR xyzzy (1)
linker to find them. The symdef entry is then compressed
using the WBG (Whiz-Bang-Gizmo) algorithm.
All files are processed in the order specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c <config-file>"

.I config-file
instead of
.IR /etc/ndppd.conf .

.B ndppd
and puts it into the background. It also
