2. About 'ndppd'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ndppd, or 'NDP Proxy Daemon', is a daemon (!!) that proxies NDP
   (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) messages between interfaces. 

   The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a protocol in the Internet 
   Protocol Suite used with Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). It 
   operates in the Link Layer of the Internet model (RFC 1122) and is 
   responsible for address autoconfiguration of nodes, discovery of 
   other nodes on the link, determining the Link Layer addresses 
   of other nodes, duplicate address detection, finding available 
   routers and Domain Name System (DNS) servers, address prefix 
   discovery, and maintaining reachability information about the paths 
   to other active neighbor nodes (RFC 4861). (Wikipedia)

   Before an IPv6 packet can be sent to a host, that host's link-layer
   address must first be found. This is done by sending a Neighbor
   Solicitation message containing the requested target IPv6 address
   to a specific multicast address.  If a host have configured a
   matching IP, that host will then respond with a Neighbor 
   Advertisement message, and provide it's link-layer address. 

   Let's say you want to route some IPs to another interface, and
   your ISP isn't truly routing your subnet to your host. It means
   that your host will have respond to Neighbor Solicitation messages
   for IPs it haven't configured in order to be able to route them.

   Linux have a limited support for proxying Neighbor Solicitation 
   messages to other interfaces, by turning on 'proxy_ndp'. But in
   order for this to work, each individual IP you want to proxy needs
   to be added to the neighbor proxy table using:

      ip -6 neigh add proxy <ip> dev <if>

   Unfortunately, it doesn't support listing proxies, and as I said,
   only individual IPs are supported. No subnets.

   'ndppd' solves this by listening for Neighbor Solicitation messages 
   on an interface, then query the internal interfaces for that target
   IP before finally sending a Neighbor Advertisement message. 

   You can create rules to query one interface for one subnet, and 
   another interface for another. 'ndppd' can even respond directly to 
   Neighbor Solicitation messages without querying anything, should you 
   need that.

3. Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This daemon depends on 'libconfuse'. If you're running Debian or
   Ubuntu you should be able to get that from the repositories.
   
      apt-get install libconfuse0-dev

   You can get it here otherwise:
      
      http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Compiling
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   First, make sure you have g++ and make installed.

   It should be as easy as:

      make all && make install

   If you want to enable debugging, you can type:

      make DEBUG=1 all
   
   Note that this version of the binary is much bigger, and the daemon
   produces a lot of messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Read through 'ndppd.conf.example' for guidelines how to configure
   the daemon. 

   Usage: ndppd [-d] [-c <config>]

   If '-d' is specified, the daemon will 'daemonize' itself, and enable
   syslogging.  With '-c' you can specify configuration file; the 
   default location for it is '/etc/ndppd.conf'.
